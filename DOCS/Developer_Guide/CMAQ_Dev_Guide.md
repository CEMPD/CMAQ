Introduction
=================================

This document is intended to describe general development practices within the CMAQ Modeling Community. The information contained should be read prior to starting a project within the CMAQ framework. Instructions can be used by EPA developers, CMAS-Center developers, or external developers. Notes specific to external developers are made where relevant.

Contributions
==================================

To contribute source code to the CMAQ Public repository, create a fork of the EPA CMAQ External GitHub repository.  Prospective developers should send the following information to the EPA and CMAS-Center code maintainers.  
-   What is your GitHub user name? (can be acquired at github)
-   Can your work be completed in a fork of the release repository?
    -   If no, please explain the reason.
-   What science module do you intend to develop?
-   What work do you intend to contribute to CMAQ?
-   Have you reviewed the development strategy including code consistency, benchmarking, configuration testing, compiler testing, model output validation, documentation and merging?
-   Are you able to provide ongoing support and technical guidance for your proposed contribution?

CMAQ Code Introduction
==================================
CMAQ is written in Fortran, and has an I/O layer that uses netCDF and IO/API libraries.

Repository Descriptions
==================================

The CMAQ project contains several repositories. Some of the repositories are private for development efforts while some are public for users and releases.  These repositories are described below.

The main CMAQ repositories are described in this section

Internal EPA Private CMAQ-Dev Repository
------------------------------------

This will be where CMAQ development by EPA employees occurs. This is a private repository for development efforts by employees of EPA.

External EPA Public CMAQ-Release Repository
------------------------------------

The main CMAQ release repository is located here. Users should refer to this repository for bug fixes, issues, and major releases for CMAQ.

<https://github.com/USEPA/CMAQ>

Users who wish to implement a new feature, and have that feature merged into the CMAQ repository should follow the instructions on code requirements and repository layout as an CMAQ developer would. Forks should be made of this release repository. Developers will use GitHub commands to add, commit, and push code to their forked repository.  Once their forked version of the repository code has undergone checks for code consistency, benchmark testing, and model output validation, and documentation including release notes, they may submit a pull request to the CMAQ-Release maintainer. New features will have to undergo a code review before any merge onto the release repository.  Instructions on using it to add a feature are in this (insert link) section.

External CMAS Public CMAQ-Release Repository
----------------------------------

A fork of the main CMAQ-Release release repository that is used for testing and documentation.

Development Life-cycle
=================================

EPA target schedule for CMAQ includes a final stable release of the base model that is available 6 months prior to the availability of the instrumented versions of the code.  

Prior to the release version, the model is released to the public as a development version that is not intended for regulatory or research application use.

The purpose of releasing the development version to the public is to give community members a deadline by which to submit their code for inclusion into the base model and to encourage the community to assist with configuration testing, compiler testing, benchmarking and verification of model output to help improve the code, scripts and documentation prior to a final release.  

The 6 month advance allows time for the CMAQ base model to be fully tested and vetted prior to beginning updates to the instrumented versions that are dependent on and incrementally added to the base model package.

Contributions Life-cycle
==================================

The repositories are all hosted on github.  The typical life-cycle of a project is as follows:

1. Create a design document for the project.  
2. Visit EPA's repository website https://github.com/USEPA/.
3. Create a fork of the repository.
4. Locally clone the newly created fork.
5. Create a branch within the fork, for the new feature or bug.
6. Develop branch.
7. Push complete branch to remote fork.
8. Submit a pull request to merge branch on fork to EPA's github site: https://github.com/USEPA/ 

Project contributions don't have to follow this example verbatim, but this at least
gives a general overview of the process. Some details related to this life-
cycle will be described in the following sections.


Design Documents
----------------------------------
Design documents are recommended for projects that contribute signficant changes to either an existing science module or to create a new feature within CMAQ.  They should clearly describe the justication for the project, and the changes and impacts of the project.  
Core maintainers reserve the right to deny a pull request that lacks a design document.  

Developers can refer to xxx and xxx for examples of design documents that have been previously completed and approved. 


Fork CMAQ-Release Code
----------------------------------
- Obtain an account on GitHub
- visit EPA/CMAQ page
<https://github.com/USEPA/CMAQ>
- in the upper right hand corner of the page is a button
     + hover over the Fork button, and you should see a Tooltip that says "Fork your own copy of EPA/CMAQ to your account
- visit your github account
<https://github.com>
     + on the right are two lists
            - Repositories you contribute to
            - Your repositories
     + click on the CMAQ repository under your repositories to view your forked CMAQ-Release version

- Tips for managing your fork
      + if your fork is behind the EPA's you can bring it up to date using the following instructions
<https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/>

Locally Clone the Newly Created Fork
----------------------------------
Follow these instructions:

1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository https://github.com/USEPA/.

2.  In the upper right of the page click on Fork this Repository

3.  You will be prompted by GitHub to tell what Github Repostitory to fork it to "Where should we fork this repository?" 

4.  Go to the newly Forked Repository on your GitHub page.

5.  In the Clone with HTTPs section, click to copy the clone URL for this forked repository. 

6.  Open a Terminal on your computer

7.  Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made

8.  Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 5.

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
    ```

Switch to the current release Branch
----------------------------------
     git checkout 5.2


Create a new Branch
----------------------------------

- Create a new branch on your local machine (git makes a copy of the 5.2 branch) and switch to this branch 

      git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]

- Example `git checkout -b 5.2_develop_new

- Change to this branch (make it your working branch)
  
      git checkout [name_of_your_new_branch]

- Example `git checkout 5.2_develop_new`


Merging Code
----------------------------------

## Submit changes to your forked repository on Github
- Use git to commit code and documentation to your fork

      + View a list of files that have been modified in your local repository

              git status

      + Add files that have been modified, to be traced in your local git repository

              git add new_module_file
      + Commit files that have been added to your local git repository

              git commit -m "new module edits"

      + Transfer the files from your local repository to your forked repository

              git push

Pull requests
----------------------------------

- use GitHub Website to view your CMAQ Fork
- go to the branch that you have committed code, example: 5.2_develop_new 
- Submit a pull request



Branches 
========================
As a developer, most work will be completed in a branch. This branch can be one of several types of branches. To give an overview of the current branching strategy, please see this [link](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).  

The name of a branch should be descriptive and tell where the feature addition will be. For example, if the branch is intended to implement multiple blocks, the majority of its work would take place in framework.  A good name for the branch would then be framework/multiple blocks.  


Feature Branches
--------------------------------
- review this language..
Feature branches should only be created from the develop branch. This allows a cleaner work flow when planning releases. Any features that have been merged onto develop can be staged for release. This means, if you submit a pull request for a feature to be merged onto the CMAQ version of develop, you are giving consent for it to be included in the next coordinated release.


Release Branches
----------------------------------

One of the variable branch types that developers will see in the shared repository is a release branch. This release branch is used to prepare the code for a new release, and comes with some guidelines of use.  As per the branch document listed in section XX, release branches should branch from develop. Once they are complete, they are merged into both develop and master. After they are merged into master, that commit is tagged with a new version number, and then pushed into the CMAQ-Release repository for a public release.  A feature branch can be thought of as a feature freeze. Once the release branch is created, no new features can make it into the next release. The only commits that can be appended to a release branch are clean up and bug fix commits.


Development Branches
---------------------------------

Once a release date is selected, it should be anounced to the CMAQ developers list to alert all core developers.


Version Numbers
=================================

5.2
5.2Gamma
5.2Beta

Release Version
---------------------
CMAQ will have a number versioning system for each release version branch, using major and alpha, beta, gamma increments.

Development Version
---------------------
CMAQ combines the number versioning system with an alphanumeric string that increments using the greek alphabet to denote each development version branch.
5.2 alpha, 5.2 beta, 5.2 gamma refers to intermediate bug fixes of the development version that after completing testing and review, will be released as 5.2.

(this needs to be edited, as we are not merging back to master, and we don't have a development branch...)
Referring to the branching strategy, coordinated releases occur when a release branch is created of off develop and merged back into
develop and master.  While an intermediate bug fix happens when a branch is created from a master and merged back into master and develop.

The patch version (third digit) of CMAQ increments with a new bug fix branch.These minor versions never include feature additions to any of the science modules or shared framework.

The minor version (second digit) of CMAQ increments when a new development branch has been developed. A release branch includes all of the features that were present on the development branch when it was created. The development branch persists for some period of time to allow core developers to "clean up" any issues they have prior to release. After the grace period, the development branch is merged into the release and the minor version of CMAQ increments by 1, while the patch version is reset to 0. 

The major version (first digit) of CMAQ increments when significant development changes are proposed. 

Maintenance Version
---------------------
All versions that have been released as a stable version number are retained on the github as branches, beginning from version 4.7.1.

Development Strategy
==================================

As developers of CMAQ, we attempt to make the code look as uniform as we can across the entire code-base. In order to enforce this, there are a set of guidelines developers should follow.

Code Consistency
------------------------------

(review and edit!)
- Each science module has a name and abbreviation, and for each method within each science module there is a defined abbreviation.  For example:
- The science module named horizontal advection has the abreviation hadv and the available method is abbreviated as yamo.
- The science module named vertical advection has the abreviation vadv, and the available methods are abbreviated as wrf and yamo.
- All subroutines should be named in a manner which prevents namespace conflicts.
- Subroutine names should all be upper case, with underscores in place of spaces
- Variable names should be upper case, with underscores in place of spaces).
- In general, variable names should be self-descriptive (e.g. NCELLS rather than N).

Benchmark Dataset
------------------------------
The U.S. EPA Calnex 12km domain July 2, 2011 testing dataset is provided with the CMAQ-Dev Release. This dataset is distributed with CMAQv5.2 to use for benchmarking the model installation. 


Testing 
------------------------------

- Developers need to test using multiple compilers, multiple processor configurations, and singel processor configuration runs for single day to verify answers match the previous stable release, and/or that the answers are computationally and physically reasonable.
- Developers need to share results of tests and request review of the documentation prior to a merge.
- Developers of CMAQ code will need to request review from the CMAQ maintainers by submitting a pull request, and requesting a merge.

Two classes of tests:

- Compiler tests used the default benchmark configuration with different compilers and MPI configurations.

- Configuration tests used the Portland Group 15.7 OpenMPI compiler to generate executables that exercise different scientific configurations of the release software.

Compiler flags:

- PGI: -Mfixed -O3 -Mextend
- GCC: -ffixed-form -ffixed-line-length-132 -O3 -funroll-loops -finit-character=32
- Intel: -fixed -132 -O3 -override-limits -fno-alias -mp1 -fp-model precise -fp-model source -shared-intel -openmp

- In the Intel Basic Test: -fixed -132 -O3 -openmp
- In the NoOpt Tests: -O0 with extend source and fixed line length flags
